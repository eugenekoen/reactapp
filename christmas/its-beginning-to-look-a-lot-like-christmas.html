  IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK A LOT LIKE CHRISTMAS
  -------------------------------------------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
              C                  F       C
  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
        E         F/A  
  Everywhere you go
              Dm                   G     C               A
  Take a look in the Five and Ten, glistening once again 
        G               D             Dm7  G7
  With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
              C                  F       C
  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
              E      F   A  
  Toys in every store
              Dm                 G
  But the prettiest sight to see
              C               A
  Is the holly that will be
              Dm   G7    C
  On your own  front door
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
              E7
  A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots 
              A       E7        A
  Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
      D
  Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
              G7      D          G
  Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
        G7              D
  And mom and dad can hardly wait
        G7        D        G7
  For school to start again
  
  INTERLUDE
  ---------
  C    F    C    C    E     F     A     
  Dm7     Em      C     A      Dm      G7     C  
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
              C                  F       C
  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
        E         F/A  
  Everywhere you go
              Dm                  G      
  There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
  C                  A   
  One in the park as well
        G                D                Dm7  G7
  The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
              C                  F       C    
  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
              E          F/A  
  Soon the bells will start
              Dm                        Em
  And the thing that will make them ring
              C               A
  Is the carol that you sing
              Dm  G7   C 
  Right within  your heart
