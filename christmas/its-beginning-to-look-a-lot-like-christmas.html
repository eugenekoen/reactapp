  IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK A LOT LIKE CHRISTMAS

  VERSE 1

         E                  A       E
  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
       G#        A/C# 
  Everywhere you go
         F#m                  B     E               C#
  Take a look in the Five and Ten, glistening once again 
       B               F#            F#m7 B7
  With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
         E                  A       E
  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
          G#     A   C# 
  Toys in every store
          F#m                G#m
  But the prettiest sight to see
         E               C#
  Is the holly that will be
          F#m  B7    E
  On your own  front door
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
            G#7
  A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots 
         C#      G#7       C#
  Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
  B7                       F#
  Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
         B7      F#         B
  Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
      B7              F#
  And mom and dad can hardly wait
      B7        F#       B7
  For school to start again
  
  INTERLUDE

  E    A    E    E    G#    A     C#

  VERSE 2

         E                  A       E
  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
       G#        A/C# 
  Everywhere you go
            F#m                 B      
  There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
  E                  C#  
  One in the park as well
      B                F#               F#m7 B7
  The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
         E                  A       E    
  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
           G#         A/C# 
  Soon the bells will start
          F#m                       G#m
  And the thing that will make them ring
         E               C#
  Is the carol that you sing
            F#m B7   E 
  Right within  your heart
