  RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER
  ------------------------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
           C          Bm7        Am7         G
  You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen  
  C         Bm7       Am7        G
  Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
  Em           A
  But do you recall
           A7                 D7
  The most famous reindeer of all
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  G
  Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
                   D
  Had a very shiny nose
  D
  And if you ever saw it
                        G
  You would even say it glows
  G
  All of the other reindeer
                             D
  Used to laugh and call him names
  D
  They never let poor Rudolph
                       G
  Play in any reindeer games
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  C              G
  Then one foggy Christmas Eve
  C             G
  Santa came to say
  D
  Rudolph with your nose so bright
  A7                 D7
  Won't you guide my sleigh tonight   
  
  OUTRO
  -----
  G
  Then how the reindeer loved him
                           D
  As they shouted out with glee
  D
  Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
                    G
  You'll go down in history
