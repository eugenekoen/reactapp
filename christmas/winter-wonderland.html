  WINTER WONDERLAND
  -----------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  G
  Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
  D
  In the lane, snow is glistening
   D9           D       D7
  A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
  Em           D            G
  Walking in a winter wonderland
  G
  Gone away is the bluebird
  D           D7
  Here to stay is a new bird
       D9       D      D7
  He sings a love song, as we go along
  Em             D          G
  Walking in a winter wonderland
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  B             C#m            B
  In the meadow we can build a snowman
        C#m           B/D#
  And pretend that he is Parson Brown
  D                    G
  He'll say,  are you married
   D
  We'll say,  no man
          A
  But you can do the job
      D7
  When you're in town
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  G
  Later on, we'll conspire
  D
  As we dream by the fire
  D9         D                D7
  To face unafraid, the plans that we've made 
  Em           D            G
  Walking in a winter wonderland
  
  CHORUS 2
  --------
  B             C#m            B
  In the meadow we can build a snowman
         C#m           B/D#
  Then pretend that he's a circus clown
  D                  G               D
  We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
       A              D7
  Until the other kids knock him down
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
  G          
  When it snows, ain't it thrilling
   D            D7  D
  Though your nose gets a chilling
        D9         D      D7
  We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
  Em           D            G
  Walking in a winter wonderland
