  WINTER WONDERLAND
  -----------------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
                E
  Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
            B
  In the lane, snow is glistening
     B           A       B              A
  A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
    A#          F#            E
  Walking in a winter wonderland
        E
  Gone away is the bluebird
            B           B7
  Here to stay is a new bird
       B           A       B           A
  He sings a love song, as we go along
  A#          F#            E
  Walking in a winter wonderland
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  G#            C#            G#
  In the meadow we can build a snowman
  G#            C#            G#
  And pretend that he is Parson Brown
  B                    E
  He'll say,  are you married
               B
  We'll say,  no man
              F#
  But you can do the job
                  B7
  When you're in town
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  E
  Later on, we'll conspire
  B
  As we dream by the fire
  B           A       B              A
  To face unafraid, the plans that we've made 
  A#          F#            E
  Walking in a winter wonderland
  
  CHORUS 2
  --------
  G#            C#            G#
  In the meadow we can build a snowman
  G#            C#            G#
  Then pretend that he's a circus clown
  B                  E               B
  We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
        F#             B7
  Until the other kids knock him down
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
  E          
  When it snows, ain't it thrilling
        B            B7  B
  Though your nose gets a chilling
  B           A       B              A
  We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
  A#          F#            E
  Walking in a winter wonderland
